Main Menu
===================================

Upon opening DemoChief you will see several areas that are used to control the application and display information.  Across the top, you will see a main menu that provides File, View, Report and Help sub-menu options.

 - The File menu is used to exit the application which you can also do by left clicking on the |imgClose| control at the top right corner of the application window.
 - The View menu allows you to open other system components that are described later in this document.
 - The Report menu provides a Detailed Activity Report.
 - Finally, the Help menu allows you to access this documentation as well as a bug / enhancement reporting form and information about the version of DemoChief that you are using.
